# Handwritten-Equation-Solver

<h2>Overview</h2>
The dataset used for training the CNN consisted of 10,000 images of handwritten equations. The images were divided into a training set of 8,000 images and a test set of 2,000 images.
The CNN was trained for 100 epochs, with a batch size of 128. The learning rate was set to 0.0001.
The accuracy of the CNN on the test set was 98.46%. This means that the CNN was able to correctly identify the symbols in the equations in the test set with an accuracy of 98.46%.
The project was implemented using Google Colab, a free cloud-based platform that allows users to run Python code.
The project used the following Python libraries: NumPy, OpenCV2, PIL, OS.path, Pandas, Pickle, Keras.models, Keras.layers, and Conv2D.

<h2>Implementation</h2>
• The project is about developing a handwritten equation solver using CNNs. CNNs are a type of deep learning algorithm that are particularly well-suited for image recognition tasks. In this project, the CNN was trained on a dataset of handwritten equations. The dataset included equations from a variety of different sources, such as textbooks, homework assignments, and exams.

• The project used Google Colab, NumPy, OpenCV2, PIL, OS.path, Pandas, Pickle, Keras.models, Keras.layers, and Conv2D. Google Colab is a free cloud-based platform that allows users to run Python code. NumPy is a library for working with arrays in Python. OpenCV2 is a library for image processing in Python. PIL is a library for image manipulation in Python. OS.path is a library for working with file paths in Python. Pandas is a library for data analysis in Python. Pickle is a library for serializing and de-serializing Python objects. Keras.models is a module for creating and training Keras models. Keras.layers is a module for creating Keras layers. Conv2D is a type of Keras layer that is used for 2D convolution.

• The project achieved a decent accuracy of 98.46%. This means that the CNN was able to correctly identify the symbols in the equations with an accuracy of 98.46%. This is a significant achievement, as it shows that the CNN is able to generalize well to new data.
